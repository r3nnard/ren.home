					<h1>"How Can i ask you a question for you to awnser here?"</h1>
                    <h3>Just DM it to me on twitter, my tag is @FreakyRennard.</h3>

					<h1>"What is your Number 1 Fetish?"</h1>
                    <h3>The age old questions xD Well i got 2 i really like.</h3>
					<h3>One is the good old footfetish. The other One is just ass.</h3>
					<h3>I dont think i have to explain what the footfetish is about lmao.</h3>
					<h3>Ass for me is one of the most interesting parts on someone because of smell and taste.</h3>
					<h3>Everyone smells and tastes different also its often musky so idk i love that.</h3>
					<h3>Its not even a unique fetish since most people in the furryfandom like that stuff.</h3>
					&nbsp
					<h1>"More into boys or girls?"</h1>
                    <h3>If i would have to decide i would probably go with girls tbh, but both can be hot asf.</h3>
					<h3>But very girly boys are hot asf too. I like feminine looks and acting a lot.</h3>
					<h3>Not saying i hate men and all but if i would have to decie its probably that.</h3>
					&nbsp
					<h1>"Ever had a gangbang?"</h1>
					<h3>I dont know what counts as a gangbang but i had 3 or 4somes.</h3>
					<h3>Definetly on my bucketlist tho, no doubt.</h3>
					<h3>I wont leave this world without having done it.</h3>
					&nbsp
					<h1>"Any things you really want to change in the year 2026?"</h1>
					<h3>Yeah i wanna do something big, something that will help my mental health a lot but probably be a lot of work.</h3>
					<h3>But i got to do it, maybe ill tell you guys here one day, maybe.</h3>
					<h3>For now i think i will keep it to myself.</h3>
					&nbsp
					<h1>"How are you mentally?"</h1>
					<h3>In the last 2 weeks i had several people on discord and telegram ask me that and heres the awnser:)</h3>
					<h3>I am alive and i think thats really it, i am not really well but not dead yet.</h3>
					<h3>I just need more people arround me that are better for me and dont stress me as much.</h3>
					<h3>Thats why i want to socialize more again so i can get to know some people that can help me to get there.</h3>
					&nbsp
					<h1>"What is some autistic ass hobby or interest you got?"</h1>
					<h3>I got a few but one i can instantly think of is radios, like the ones to listen to music or the ones you can talk with.</h3>
					<h3>I just like the concept of being able to exchange information and such without internet and stuff.</h3>
					<h3>Plus i got some cool radios to talk to some peeps and listen to some cool broadcasts.</h3>
					<h3>I would say thats pretty autistic, judge me haha.</h3>
