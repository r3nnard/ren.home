                    <h3>Today is kind of weird, not really anything happening.</h3>
					<h3>Later i will go and visit a friend of mine and we will see each other again after a long time!</h3>
					<h3>Thats pretty much the only cool thing thats going on for me today.</h3>
					<h3>I will probably take a nice shower too later and then talk to friends on discord.</h3>
					<h3>Since my bf again has other priorities on these days.</h3>
					<h3>Guess thats just how it is. Cant do shit about it.</h3>
					<h3>Hope we at least call this evening :) we will see, we will see.</h3>

                    <h3>Sooo Today was chrismtas eve and the whole family came together to celebrate it.</h3>
					<h3>Well kinda whole family, my bf wasnt here he was with his family.</h3>
					<h3>We barely even talked today not even texting. I find that a bit annoying.</h3>
					<h3>Christmas means more to me than my birthday and me and my "partner" did not talk a lot on that day.</h3>
					<h3>Feels weird ngl, but moving on.</h3>
					<h3>Ive spent the time with family and some friends, we all drank wine and beer and ate some good selfmade cookies.</h3>
					<h3>Gosh those were so freaking good.</h3>
					<h3>Oh and the gifts i got were all like money lmao.</h3>
					<h3>Got one special gift from a close friend tho wich was cool.</h3>
					<h3>All in all okayish day but could have been way better, weakest chrismas in years.</h3>
