                    <h3>Okay so its exactly how i thought it would be. He texts he cant call because of whatever or that we need to do it at some other point.</h3>
					<h3>He spammed me on whatsapp with stupid shit just to drive me insane and we now just had a small talk on discord like call.</h3>
					<h3>In wich he acted once again selfish and foolish. He does it on purpose im sure now. No one else would act like that.</h3>
					<h3>He never listens to me, he ignores what i say, and no matter what i try to save this relationship he sabotages that.</h3>
					<h3>I am 100% convinced now that he is trying to mentally destroy me. No doubt.</h3>
					<h3>No matter how much i talk to him about things he always ignores that and acts offended and like some sort of victim in this whole thing.</h3>
					<h3>Now he fucked up we left the call he is gonna do some other shit(after promising a call since yesterday and planning it for a day).</h3>
					<h3>And before he went offline he spammed me some stupid retarded messages on discord again. Proofing my point again that he wants to mentally kill me.</h3>
					<h3>No matter what i try he just wants to make sure i suffer. I need help.</h3>

					<h1>25th December 2025 / 3:30Pm</h1>
                    <h3>Today is kind of weird, not really anything happening.</h3>
					<h3>Later i will go and visit a friend of mine and we will see each other again after a long time!</h3>
					<h3>Thats pretty much the only cool thing thats going on for me today.</h3>
					<h3>I will probably take a nice shower too later and then talk to friends on discord.</h3>
					<h3>Since my bf again has other priorities on these days.</h3>
					<h3>Guess thats just how it is. Cant do shit about it.</h3>
					<h3>Hope we at least call this evening :) we will see, we will see.</h3>

                    <h3>Sooo Today was chrismtas eve and the whole family came together to celebrate it.</h3>
					<h3>Well kinda whole family, my bf wasnt here he was with his family.</h3>
					<h3>We barely even talked today not even texting. I find that a bit annoying.</h3>
					<h3>Christmas means more to me than my birthday and me and my "partner" did not talk a lot on that day.</h3>
					<h3>Feels weird ngl, but moving on.</h3>
					<h3>Ive spent the time with family and some friends, we all drank wine and beer and ate some good selfmade cookies.</h3>
					<h3>Gosh those were so freaking good.</h3>
					<h3>Oh and the gifts i got were all like money lmao.</h3>
					<h3>Got one special gift from a close friend tho wich was cool.</h3>
					<h3>All in all okayish day but could have been way better, weakest chrismas in years.</h3>
