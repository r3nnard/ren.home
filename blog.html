                    <h3>Sooo Today was chrismtas eve and the whole family came together to celebrate it.</h3>
					<h3>Well kinda whole family, my bf wasnt here he was with his family.</h3>
					<h3>We barely even talked today not even texting. I find that a bit annoying.</h3>
					<h3>Christmas means more to me than my birthday and me and my "partner" did not talk a lot on that day.</h3>
					<h3>Feels weird ngl, but moving on.</h3>
					<h3>Ive spent the time with family and some friends, we all drank wine and beer and ate some good selfmade cookies.</h3>
					<h3>Gosh those were so freaking good.</h3>
					<h3>Oh and the gifts i got were all like money lmao.</h3>
					<h3>Got one special gift from a close friend tho wich was cool.</h3>
					<h3>All in all okayish day but could have been way better, weakest chrismas in years.</h3>
